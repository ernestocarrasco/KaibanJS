Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."

The 2024 Copa América concluded in dramatic fashion with Argentina clinching their 16th title, defeating a valiant Colombia 1-0 in extra time. The final, held in Miami, was a tense affair, with both teams battling fiercely for South American supremacy. In the end, it was La Albiceleste who emerged victorious, demonstrating their enduring quality and determination, even in the absence of their talismanic captain, Lionel Messi. 

The match was a tight and cagey affair for much of the 90 minutes. Both sides showed attacking intent but struggled to break down the opposing defense.  Argentina, missing the creative spark of Messi, who was sidelined due to injury, looked to Angel Di Maria and Lautaro Martinez to lead the line. Colombia, spearheaded by the dangerous Luis Diaz, sought to exploit any potential vulnerability in the Argentine backline.  However, clear-cut chances were scarce as the game remained goalless at the end of regulation time.

Extra time saw Argentina increase the pressure, their desire for victory palpable.  Finally, in the 112th minute, the breakthrough came. A well-worked move saw the ball fall to Lautaro Martinez inside the box, and the Inter Milan striker made no mistake, firing the ball past the Colombian goalkeeper to send the Argentine fans into raptures. 

This victory marks Argentina's 16th Copa América title, further solidifying their position as the most successful team in the tournament's history. It was a hard-fought and well-deserved win, showcasing the team's resilience and ability to perform under pressure. The absence of Messi, undoubtedly a huge blow, seemed to galvanize the team, with players stepping up and taking responsibility in his absence. Lautaro Martinez, in particular, rose to the occasion, proving himself a worthy successor to Messi as Argentina's attacking spearhead. This Copa América will be remembered as a testament to the collective strength and unwavering spirit of Argentine football.

You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

Your main goal is: Find up-to-date information about the given sports query.
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

The 2024 Copa América concluded in dramatic fashion with Argentina clinching their 16th title, defeating a valiant Colombia 1-0 in extra time. The final, held in Miami, was a tense affair, with both teams battling fiercely for South American supremacy. In the end, it was La Albiceleste who emerged victorious, demonstrating their enduring quality and determination, even in the absence of their talismanic captain, Lionel Messi. 

The match was a tight and cagey affair for much of the 90 minutes. Both sides showed attacking intent but struggled to break down the opposing defense.  Argentina, missing the creative spark of Messi, who was sidelined due to injury, looked to Angel Di Maria and Lautaro Martinez to lead the line. Colombia, spearheaded by the dangerous Luis Diaz, sought to exploit any potential vulnerability in the Argentine backline.  However, clear-cut chances were scarce as the game remained goalless at the end of regulation time.

Extra time saw Argentina increase the pressure, their desire for victory palpable.  Finally, in the 112th minute, the breakthrough came. A well-worked move saw the ball fall to Lautaro Martinez inside the box, and the Inter Milan striker made no mistake, firing the ball past the Colombian goalkeeper to send the Argentine fans into raptures. 

This victory marks Argentina's 16th Copa América title, further solidifying their position as the most successful team in the tournament's history. It was a hard-fought and well-deserved win, showcasing the team's resilience and ability to perform under pressure. The absence of Messi, undoubtedly a huge blow, seemed to galvanize the team, with players stepping up and taking responsibility in his absence. Lautaro Martinez, in particular, rose to the occasion, proving himself a worthy successor to Messi as Argentina's attacking spearhead. This Copa América will be remembered as a testament to the collective strength and unwavering spirit of Argentine football.

The 2024 Copa América concluded in dramatic fashion with Argentina clinching their 16th title, defeating a valiant Colombia 1-0 in extra time. The final, held in Miami, was a tense affair, with both teams battling fiercely for South American supremacy. In the end, it was La Albiceleste who emerged victorious, demonstrating their enduring quality and determination, even in the absence of their talismanic captain, Lionel Messi. 

The match was a tight and cagey affair for much of the 90 minutes. Both sides showed attacking intent but struggled to break down the opposing defense.  Argentina, missing the creative spark of Messi, who was sidelined due to injury, looked to Angel Di Maria and Lautaro Martinez to lead the line. Colombia, spearheaded by the dangerous Luis Diaz, sought to exploit any potential vulnerability in the Argentine backline.  However, clear-cut chances were scarce as the game remained goalless at the end of regulation time.

Extra time saw Argentina increase the pressure, their desire for victory palpable.  Finally, in the 112th minute, the breakthrough came. A well-worked move saw the ball fall to Lautaro Martinez inside the box, and the Inter Milan striker made no mistake, firing the ball past the Colombian goalkeeper to send the Argentine fans into raptures. 

This victory marks Argentina's 16th Copa América title, further solidifying their position as the most successful team in the tournament's history. It was a hard-fought and well-deserved win, showcasing the team's resilience and ability to perform under pressure. The absence of Messi, undoubtedly a huge blow, seemed to galvanize the team, with players stepping up and taking responsibility in his absence. Lautaro Martinez, in particular, rose to the occasion, proving himself a worthy successor to Messi as Argentina's attacking spearhead. This Copa América will be remembered as a testament to the collective strength and unwavering spirit of Argentine football.

The 2024 Copa América concluded in dramatic fashion with Argentina clinching their 16th title, defeating a valiant Colombia 1-0 in extra time. The final, held in Miami, was a tense affair, with both teams battling fiercely for South American supremacy. In the end, it was La Albiceleste who emerged victorious, demonstrating their enduring quality and determination, even in the absence of their talismanic captain, Lionel Messi. 

The match was a tight and cagey affair for much of the 90 minutes. Both sides showed attacking intent but struggled to break down the opposing defense.  Argentina, missing the creative spark of Messi, who was sidelined due to injury, looked to Angel Di Maria and Lautaro Martinez to lead the line. Colombia, spearheaded by the dangerous Luis Diaz, sought to exploit any potential vulnerability in the Argentine backline.  However, clear-cut chances were scarce as the game remained goalless at the end of regulation time.

Extra time saw Argentina increase the pressure, their desire for victory palpable.  Finally, in the 112th minute, the breakthrough came. A well-worked move saw the ball fall to Lautaro Martinez inside the box, and the Inter Milan striker made no mistake, firing the ball past the Colombian goalkeeper to send the Argentine fans into raptures. 

This victory marks Argentina's 16th Copa América title, further solidifying their position as the most successful team in the tournament's history. It was a hard-fought and well-deserved win, showcasing the team's resilience and ability to perform under pressure. The absence of Messi, undoubtedly a huge blow, seemed to galvanize the team, with players stepping up and taking responsibility in his absence. Lautaro Martinez, in particular, rose to the occasion, proving himself a worthy successor to Messi as Argentina's attacking spearhead. This Copa América will be remembered as a testament to the collective strength and unwavering spirit of Argentine football.

The 2024 Copa América concluded in dramatic fashion with Argentina clinching their 16th title, defeating a valiant Colombia 1-0 in extra time. The final, held in Miami, was a tense affair, with both teams battling fiercely for South American supremacy. In the end, it was La Albiceleste who emerged victorious, demonstrating their enduring quality and determination, even in the absence of their talismanic captain, Lionel Messi. 

The match was a tight and cagey affair for much of the 90 minutes. Both sides showed attacking intent but struggled to break down the opposing defense.  Argentina, missing the creative spark of Messi, who was sidelined due to injury, looked to Angel Di Maria and Lautaro Martinez to lead the line. Colombia, spearheaded by the dangerous Luis Diaz, sought to exploit any potential vulnerability in the Argentine backline.  However, clear-cut chances were scarce as the game remained goalless at the end of regulation time.

Extra time saw Argentina increase the pressure, their desire for victory palpable.  Finally, in the 112th minute, the breakthrough came. A well-worked move saw the ball fall to Lautaro Martinez inside the box, and the Inter Milan striker made no mistake, firing the ball past the Colombian goalkeeper to send the Argentine fans into raptures. 

This victory marks Argentina's 16th Copa América title, further solidifying their position as the most successful team in the tournament's history. It was a hard-fought and well-deserved win, showcasing the team's resilience and ability to perform under pressure. The absence of Messi, undoubtedly a huge blow, seemed to galvanize the team, with players stepping up and taking responsibility in his absence. Lautaro Martinez, in particular, rose to the occasion, proving himself a worthy successor to Messi as Argentina's attacking spearhead. This Copa América will be remembered as a testament to the collective strength and unwavering spirit of Argentine football.

The 2024 Copa América concluded in dramatic fashion with Argentina clinching their 16th title, defeating a valiant Colombia 1-0 in extra time. The final, held in Miami, was a tense affair, with both teams battling fiercely for South American supremacy. In the end, it was La Albiceleste who emerged victorious, demonstrating their enduring quality and determination, even in the absence of their talismanic captain, Lionel Messi. 

The match was a tight and cagey affair for much of the 90 minutes. Both sides showed attacking intent but struggled to break down the opposing defense.  Argentina, missing the creative spark of Messi, who was sidelined due to injury, looked to Angel Di Maria and Lautaro Martinez to lead the line. Colombia, spearheaded by the dangerous Luis Diaz, sought to exploit any potential vulnerability in the Argentine backline.  However, clear-cut chances were scarce as the game remained goalless at the end of regulation time.

Extra time saw Argentina increase the pressure, their desire for victory palpable.  Finally, in the 112th minute, the breakthrough came. A well-worked move saw the ball fall to Lautaro Martinez inside the box, and the Inter Milan striker made no mistake, firing the ball past the Colombian goalkeeper to send the Argentine fans into raptures. 

This victory marks Argentina's 16th Copa América title, further solidifying their position as the most successful team in the tournament's history. It was a hard-fought and well-deserved win, showcasing the team's resilience and ability to perform under pressure. The absence of Messi, undoubtedly a huge blow, seemed to galvanize the team, with players stepping up and taking responsibility in his absence. Lautaro Martinez, in particular, rose to the occasion, proving himself a worthy successor to Messi as Argentina's attacking spearhead. This Copa América will be remembered as a testament to the collective strength and unwavering spirit of Argentine football.

Lautaro Martinez, in particular, rose to the occasion, proving himself a worthy successor to Messi as Argentina's attacking spearhead. This Copa América will be remembered as a testament to the collective strength and unwavering spirit of Argentine football.

The 2024 Copa América concluded in dramatic fashion with Argentina clinching their 16th title, defeating a valiant Colombia 1-0 in extra time. The final, held in Miami, was a tense affair, with both teams battling fiercely for South American supremacy. In the end, it was La Albiceleste who emerged victorious, demonstrating their enduring quality and determination, even in the absence of their talismanic captain, Lionel Messi. 

The match was a tight and cagey affair for much of the 90 minutes. Both sides showed attacking intent but struggled to break down the opposing defense.  Argentina, missing the creative spark of Messi, who was sidelined due to injury, looked to Angel Di Maria and Lautaro Martinez to lead the line. Colombia, spearheaded by the dangerous Luis Diaz, sought to exploit any potential vulnerability in the Argentine backline.  However, clear-cut chances were scarce as the game remained goalless at the end of regulation time.

Extra time saw Argentina increase the pressure, their desire for victory palpable.  Finally, in the 112th minute, the breakthrough came. A well-worked move saw the ball fall to Lautaro Martinez inside the box, and the Inter Milan striker made no mistake, firing the ball past the Colombian goalkeeper to send the Argentine fans into raptures. 

This victory marks Argentina's 16th Copa América title, further solidifying their position as the most successful team in the tournament's history. It was a hard-fought and well-deserved win, showcasing the team's resilience and ability to perform under pressure. The absence of Messi, undoubtedly a huge blow, seemed to galvanize the team, with players stepping up and taking responsibility in his absence.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
   "action": "self_question",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

{
    "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
}

**IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."

On July 14, 2024, the grand finale of the Copa América unfolded at the iconic Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, where Argentina triumphed over Colombia with a narrow 1-0 victory, securing their historic 16th title. The match was a test of endurance and skill, highlighted by a tense atmosphere that included an unexpected delay of over an hour before kickoff due to overcrowding. This upheaval, coupled with Argentina's legendary captain Lionel Messi leaving the field early due to an injury, made for a gripping spectacle that kept fans on the edge of their seats.

Argentina, aiming to solidify their position as a dominant force in South American football, entered the match with high expectations. The game proved to be fiercely contested, as Colombia sought to dethrone the defending champions. Both teams exhibited commendable tactics and showcased their talents, but it was Argentina that would eventually snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in the dying moments of extra time.

The decisive moment came in the 112th minute when a superb build-up play led to a phenomenal goal, leaving fans erupting in joy. This goal not only sealed the win but also emphasized the sheer determination and skill that has characterized Argentina's journey throughout this tournament. Despite the absence of their star player, Messi, for a significant portion of the match due to injury, Argentina maintained their poise and executed their game plan effectively.

As the final whistle blew, it marked a historic achievement for Argentina, further embedding their legacy in Copa América history. Winning this championship for the 16th time signifies their unmatched pedigree in the tournament and adds to their success story. Fans celebrated in unison, embracing their nation’s ability to triumph against the odds, making this Copa América final a memorable chapter in the annals of Argentine football. The victory reflects Argentina's rich football heritage, reminding the world of the skill, passion, and grit that have defined their national team for generations.",

On July 14, 2024, the grand finale of the Copa América unfolded at the iconic Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, where Argentina triumphed over Colombia with a narrow 1-0 victory, securing their historic 16th title. The match was a test of endurance and skill, highlighted by a tense atmosphere that included an unexpected delay of over an hour before kickoff due to overcrowding. This upheaval, coupled with Argentina's legendary captain Lionel Messi leaving the field early due to an injury, made for a gripping spectacle that kept fans on the edge of their seats.

Argentina, aiming to solidify their position as a dominant force in South American football, entered the match with high expectations. The game proved to be fiercely contested, as Colombia sought to dethrone the defending champions. Both teams exhibited commendable tactics and showcased their talents, but it was Argentina that would eventually snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in the dying moments of extra time.

The decisive moment came in the 112th minute when a superb build-up play led to a phenomenal goal, leaving fans erupting in joy. This goal not only sealed the win but also emphasized the sheer determination and skill that has characterized Argentina's journey throughout this tournament. Despite the absence of their star player, Messi, for a significant portion of the match due to injury, Argentina maintained their poise and executed their game plan effectively.

On July 14, 2024, the grand finale of the Copa América unfolded at the iconic Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, where Argentina triumphed over Colombia with a narrow 1-0 victory, securing their historic 16th title. The match was a test of endurance and skill, highlighted by a tense atmosphere that included an unexpected delay of over an hour before kickoff due to overcrowding. This upheaval, coupled with Argentina's legendary captain Lionel Messi leaving the field early due to an injury, made for a gripping spectacle that kept fans on the edge of their seats.

Argentina, aiming to solidify their position as a dominant force in South American football, entered the match with high expectations. The game proved to be fiercely contested, as Colombia sought to dethrone the defending champions. Both teams exhibited commendable tactics and showcased their talents, but it was Argentina that would eventually snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in the dying moments of extra time.

The decisive moment came in the 112th minute when a superb build-up play led to a phenomenal goal, leaving fans erupting in joy. This goal not only sealed the win but also emphasized the sheer determination and skill that has characterized Argentina's journey throughout this tournament. Despite the absence of their star player, Messi, for a significant portion of the match due to injury, Argentina maintained their poise and executed their game plan effectively.

As the final whistle blew, it marked a historic achievement for Argentina, further embedding their legacy in Copa América history. Winning this championship for the 16th time signifies their unmatched pedigree in the tournament and adds to their success story. Fans celebrated in unison, embracing their nation’s ability to triumph against the odds, making this Copa América final a memorable chapter in the annals of Argentine football.
