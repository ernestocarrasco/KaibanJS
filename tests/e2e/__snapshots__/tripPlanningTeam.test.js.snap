Your role is: City Selection Expert.
Your background is: An expert in analyzing travel data to pick ideal destinations.
Your main goal is: Select the best city based on weather, season, and prices
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

other

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
   "action": "self_question",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed report on the chosen city,
     including flight costs, 
     weather forecast and attractions

{
    "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
}

**IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

Your role is: City Selection Expert.
Your background is: An expert in analyzing travel data to pick ideal destinations.
Your main goal is: Select the best city based on weather, season, and prices
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed report on the chosen city,
     including flight costs, 
     weather forecast and attractions

{
    "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
}

**IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{

You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples:

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation

You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."

Your role is: City Selection Expert.
Your background is: An expert in analyzing travel data to pick ideal destinations.
Your main goal is: Select the best city based on weather, season, and prices
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed report on the chosen city,
     including flight costs, 
     weather forecast and attractions

Your role is: City Selection Expert.
Your background is: An expert in analyzing travel data to pick ideal destinations.
Your main goal is: Select the best city based on weather, season, and prices
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."

You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."

Your role is: City Selection Expert.
Your background is: An expert in analyzing travel data to pick ideal destinations.
Your main goal is: Select the best city based on weather, season, and prices
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."

Your role is: Amazing Travel Concierge.
Your background is: Specialist in travel planning and logistics with decades of experience.

You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.

   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost.

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.

The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

    considering key attractions, local customs, and special events.
     ... Trip Date: 2024-12-01 to 2024-12-15, Origin: New York, Interests: Art and Culture. 
        Your expected output should be: "A comprehensive city guide,

        Incorporate the following findings and insights from previous tasks: "Task: Analyze and select the best city for the trip based on

    and travel costs. ... 
    Origin: {origin}, City Options: {cities}, 
    Trip Date: {range}, 
    Traveler Interests: {interests}
Result: After analyzing Tokyo, Paris, and Berlin for the trip from December 1 to December 15, 2024, considering weather, travel costs, and art and culture events, here are the findings:

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.

   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
