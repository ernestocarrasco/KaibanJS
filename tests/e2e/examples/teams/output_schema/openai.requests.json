This pivotal operation, codenamed Operation Overlord, marked the beginning of the liberation of Western Europe from Nazi occupation. Involved nearly 156,000 Allied troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and other nations, the operation was intended to establish a foothold in Europe. The landings took place across five beach sectors: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. The motivation behind this massive military effort was to open a second front against Germany, which was facing pressure from the Soviet Union in the east. The successful landings led to the eventual liberation of France and a significant shift in the balance of power, contributing to the defeat of Nazi Germany. Following the initial invasion, Allied forces continued to advance through France, leading to the liberation of Paris by late August 1944.\",\n        \"time_range\": \"1944-1944\",\n        \"figures\": [\"Dwight D.
